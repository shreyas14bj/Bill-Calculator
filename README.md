# Bill-Calculator
A Bill Calculator App built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript allows users to enter items with their names, prices, and quantities,discount and tax, then calculates the total bill. The app displays the subtotal, applies any entered discount, and calculates the tax based on the provided percentages. The user can see the final total after applying the discount and adding the tax. The app provides an interactive list of added items, where users can view the price and quantity of each item. It also includes a clear function to reset the form, bill generation in the form of pdf  storing of previous bills and a responsive design to ensure it works well on both mobile and desktop devices. The logic is handled by JavaScript, which dynamically updates the bill calculation and UI as the user interacts with the app.
